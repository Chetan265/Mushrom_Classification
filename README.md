# Mushroom Classification
Mushroom is one of the fungi types foods that has the most potent nutrients on the planet. 
Mushrooms have major medicinal advantages such as killing cancer cells. This study aims to find the most appropriate technique for mushroom classification, and mushroom will be classified into two categories, poisonous and nonpoisonous.

Where the dataset contains different features of the mushrooms like cap shape, cap colour, gill shape, gill size, odor etc.The proposed approach will implement a different techniques and algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest and Boosting Techniques. Random Forest performed well with 100% accuracy. After we have done hyperparameter tuning and it is deployed on heroku platform.
