Where the dataset contains different features of the mushrooms like cap shape, cap colour, gill shape, gill size, odor etc.The proposed approach will implement a different techniques and algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest and Boosting Techniques. Random Forest performed well with 100% accuracy. After we have done hyperparameter tuning and it is deployed on heroku platform.
